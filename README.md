# Personal Portfolio & Visual Analytics Website
**Author:** Harjot Singh | 4th Year CS + IAT Student at SFU

## Purpose
This website is a professional portfolio designed to showcase my journey as a Software Engineer and Interactive Arts student. It serves a dual purpose:
1. **Professional Presence:** Highlighting my experience at Aether Automation and my technical skill set.
2. **Visual Analytics Showcase:** Demonstrating the ability to create custom, interactive data visualizations using vanilla JavaScript and SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics).

## Technologies Used
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (using custom properties/variables).
* **Interactivity:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+).
* **Visualizations:** Custom SVG generation via JavaScript (Radar Charts and Vector Art).
* **Animations:** Intersection Observer API for scroll-reveal effects.
* **Deployment:** GitHub Pages.

## Navigation
The site is divided into two main areas:
* **Professional Portfolio (`index.html`):** * **Hero Section:** Quick intro with "fun" interactive interest tags.
    * **Experience & Education:** Detailed timeline of my career and studies.
    * **Skills:** Categorized breakdown of my technical stack.
* **Visualizations (`visualizations.html`):**
    * **Skills Radar Chart:** A dynamic SVG chart mapping my proficiency levels.
    * **Hockey Rink Art:** A custom-coded SVG illustration with an animated puck.
